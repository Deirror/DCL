# DCL -> Deirror's Class Library
This library contains classes/data structures and functions which are just written in simpler way than the Microsoft ones. 

Preferably used for small project as in these classes there aren't all the implemented functions provided by Microsoft, but the most used ones + some made by me..

I provided a library which can be link statically.

Steps
--
//(My way of doing this kind of stuff)

1.Create a folder (can be "Dependencies").

2.Create folders "include" and "lib"(can be src) in "Dependencies".

-In "include" put your header files(.h/.hpp), which you wish to use.

-In "lib"/"src" put your library files(.lib).
